This application is based on the 1996 U.S. Census Income Data set.

Dataset has been obtained from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) and processed for the course project. 

The first part of application (page Exploratory Analysis) is designed to show basic statistics about USA population relatively to its income. There are three sub-panels - low-income group (annual income <= 50 K dollars a year), high-income group (annual income > 50 K a year) and panel with plots about both.

The second part (page Income Prediction) is built to predict user's potential income relatively to the different socio-economic charateristics using CART algorithm.

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub]().

The presentation for the project can be found [here]().
